## Logging
In this phase we create a logging mechanism using the python built in logging module in order to log into a file possible errors, warnings or information. 

## Loading
This is the first phase of our project in which we include all the steps regarding the import of our data. Firsly, we read the csv file from the Kaggle source and then we apply some data cleaning techniques to prepare the data for the next steps (validation checks, errors, inconsistencies, handling missing data).

## EDA
This section is called Exploratory Data Analysis. We create some plots to have a deeper understanding of the distribution of our data in both categorical and numeircal features.

## PreProcessing
This phase encaplulates all the pre-processing steps that are needed for this project such as one-hot encoding techinque for categorical data, feature scaling and data spliting into train and test set.

## Models Selection
In this phase..

## Models Deployment
