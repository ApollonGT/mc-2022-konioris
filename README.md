**Summary**

Over the last few years, android has been in the top choices in the operating tool list. It has captured around 74% of the total market which indicates that the majority of people use android as an operating system. In this project, our goals are to determine which factors prompt people to download an app and to compare the initial costs that are needed to create an app with the profit of each app category. For the scope of this analysis, we examine the most crucial features of our dataset such as category, price, ratings and installs and find out the relationship among them.

This work provides a deep exploration of the aforementioned features, so the developers will predict whether a certain application can be successful and the reason of it. For all the work of this project we use Python as a Programing language and we focus on optimization techniques to provide the results in the best way possible in terms of accuracy and computation time.

The main.py file encapsulates all the functions utilised in this project along with a parser that selects the model of the models selction module!
